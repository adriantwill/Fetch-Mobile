### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I focused on making the app performant and responsive based on the API endpoints. I also wanted to make sure all errors were properly handed.
I chose to focus on those areas because that is the core functionality of the application and important for a good user experience. 

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spend the past few days working on the application. I allocated the majority of that time on the networking and caching aspect, with the rest on the UI.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I did not make any significant trade-offs in terms of the core functionality. 
I did choose to keep file structure simple, only using one view file, but would split it further in bigger projects.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I think the weakest part of my project is the UI, as the recipe list and pages are relatively bland.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I enjoyed getting to showcase my development skills with the project.
